# ðŸ” NATO phonetic alphabet program using Python

ðŸŒŸA program which converts the input word from user into equivalent NATO phonetic list of letter equivalents.

ðŸ‘‰The data is read from the 'nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv' which contains the English alphabets and their respective NATO codes.

ðŸ‘‰The main task is to convert the data from the file into a dictionary with the (key, value) pair as (letter, code).

ðŸ‘‰This is achieved with the use of List Comprehensions & .iterrows() method of Pandas Dataframe. The List Comprehension converts the data into
desired dictionary and the logic as well as the code is quite simplified.

ðŸ‘‰The List comprehension makes the code compact and easy to understand. It is also used in the output where the NATO phonetic list of letter equivalents
is to be printed.
